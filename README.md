# Homework 5 Reflection

## Most Important Learning
The biggest thing I took away from this homework was learning how tricky it is to take existing code and add new features to it, especially when changing from a simple one-way linked list to a more complex 2D structure. It really opened my eyes to why people stress the importance of writing clean, organized code - because you (or someone else) will probably need to change it later! Working with this 2D linked structure also taught me how important it is to really think through your changes before diving in, since messing with pointers and memory in multiple directions can get complicated fast. I learned that it's way easier to fix and modify code when you actually understand how all the pieces fit together.

## Largest Difficulty
My biggest struggle was definitely updating the old code to handle the new 2D movement system and connecting all the rooms together properly. Looking back, I think I made it harder on myself by just jumping in and trying to make changes without really planning things out first. I kept running into issues where fixing one thing would break something else because I wasn't thinking about how all the pieces connected. If I could do it over, I'd start by drawing out how I want the rooms to connect on paper, maybe write some rough pseudocode to plan out the changes, and then tackle the updates in smaller, manageable chunks that I could test as I went along. That would've saved me a lot of headaches from trying to fix everything at once!
